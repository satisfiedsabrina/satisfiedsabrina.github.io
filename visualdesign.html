<h2>Artifact #3</h2>
	
	<img src="Artifacts /shoe design. sabrinaj.png" width="300" height="300" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist statement</h2>
	
	
<p>I made this project with illustrator. The tools I used were the brush tools and pen tool. I made a platform kind of sneaker, one that looks really comfortable and if they existed I would wear them on a daily basis everywhere. My shoes express that I like to wear comfortable clothes while at the same time, looking nice.

	<h2>Artist statement</h2>
	
	
	<p>I made this project with an illustrator and the tools I used were the pen tool, brush tool to shade things in, and the rectangle tool. The elements I decided to use were a cat, a floating heart, another heart that says spread, birds, and a square with heart eyes. The story my elements are telling is that everyone should be spreading love and not hate to this world.</p>
	
	
	
	
<h2>Artifact #5</h1>
	
	
	<img src="Artifacts /custom block. sabrinaj.png" width="374" height="394" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist statement</h2>
	
	
<p>I made this project in Adobe illustrator with the perspective grid tool and brush tool. The buildings I made were 4 apartments, a McDonalds, and a supermarket. The most challenging part about this project was filling in the colors. In the app it shows I colored everything good but in the file it has some missing fillings.

<h2>Artifact #6</h2>
	
	
	<img src="Artifacts /fantastic beast.sabrinaj.png" width="329" height="153" alt=""/>

	
	<h2>Artist statement</h2>
	
	
	
	<p>I came up with the animals by thinking of which animals I find the coolest, which a dragon popped up immediately:) The abilities my animal has is the strength of a rhino, having fire breath/ being a dragon and being an alpine ibex. First I found the animals I wanted and the body part I wanted to take and put onto my dragon. Then I hid the other layers and hid the rest of the body from the animal that i didn't want, after that i combined the parts together and kind of blurred around the area so that it wouldn't look so weird and out of place.

<h2>Artifact #7</h2>
	
	<img src="Artifacts /self protrait. sabrinaj.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist statement</h2>
	
	
<p>I made this project with Adobe illustrator. The tools that I used were the brush tool to fill out my original picture. In this project I used 11 shades in my value scale and that was surprising because it didn't seem that much when I was using them. The hardest part about creating this project was making the picture look accurate because I didn't want it to look too cartoony and the easiest part was putting a different shade in each section of the photo since it was easier to see the light and darker parts.

<h2>Artifact #8</h2>
	<img src="Artifacts /custom potato head. sabrinaj.png" width="258" height="278" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist statement</h2>
	
<p>I made this project by logging into my creative cloud account and going to photoshop. The tools that I used were the move tool and quick selection tool. The parts I used for my project were a mango body, top hat, sneakers, eyebrows, arms that I drew, eyes, a nose, and mouth. The personality that my creation has is a classy gentleman that always tries different styles for fun and to be “trendy’’. If I were to sell it in an actual toy store I would give him legs, thicker arms, and maybe a bowtie.</p>
